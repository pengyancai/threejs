The code shows a simple example of integration of threejs and draco javascript
or WebAssembly decoder. From the example, you should be able to load an
encoded draco mesh file and visualize it through threejs's fancy 3D tools.

How to run the example code:

(1) Clone this project to a working directory, e.g. draco/.

(2) From the project's root directory, start a local http server.
E.g, with Python, you could run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer".

(3) Load javascript/example/webgl_loader_draco.html. You should be able to see
an empty scene rendered by threejs.

(4) Click "Choose File" to select a draco encoded file (.drc) and you should be
able to see the model. e.g. bunny.drc. This is model encoded using Draco
default compression. The original ply is located here "testdata/bun_zipper.ply".
